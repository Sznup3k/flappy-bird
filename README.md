# flappy-bird

## This is my code for flappy bird in lua using LÖVE2D. Everything is strongly inspired or copied from the [GD50 course Lecture 1.](https://youtu.be/3IdOCxHGMIo)<br>

## Installation instructions for the users
**This guide is for the installation on windows. If you are on a machine with a different system go to the [LÖVE2D wiki](https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started).** <br>
First install the LÖVE2 framework from the official [LÖVE2D page](https://love2d.org). Next download the Src folder from this repo.
Them create a shortcut and in the path box write `"[LOVE installation path]\love.exe\" "[Src installation path]\Src\"` which in my case looks like this: 
`"C:\Program Files\LOVE\love.exe" "C:\Games\GD50\Flappy_bird-1\Src".`. If you want a more detailed explanation or you are not using Windows go to the [LÖVE2D](https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started).
