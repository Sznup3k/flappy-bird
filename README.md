# Flappy Bird

## This is my code for flappy bird in lua using LÖVE2D. Everything is strongly inspired or copied from the [GD50 course Lecture 1.](https://youtu.be/3IdOCxHGMIo)<br>

This repo contains my code for Flappy Bird based on the Lecture 1 from the GD50 course using lua and the LÖVE2D framework. It isn't the best or most optimal code for Flappy Bird and the files structure is also really bad, because it was made for learning prupouses and it wasn't made as a seriuos project. Therefore any suggestions for improving my code probably won't be noticed or considered. Although this project isn't great I don't mind anyone downloading, playing or using it for any other purposes. If you have any questions you can write them in the issues tab, but as I said before I may not notice them. <br><br>


## Installation instructions for users<br>

**This guide is for the installation on windows. If you are on a machine with a different system go to the [LÖVE2D wiki](https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started).** <br><br>
First install the LÖVE2D framework from the official [LÖVE2D page](https://love2d.org). Next download the `Src` folder from this repo.
Then create a shortcut and in the path box put `"[LOVE installation path]\love.exe\" "[Src installation path]\Src\"`, which in my case looks like this: 
`"C:\Program Files\LOVE\love.exe" "C:\Games\GD50\Flappy_bird-1\Src"`. If you want a more detailed guide or you are not using Windows go to the [LÖVE2D wiki](https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started).
